﻿// Here are the rules for the battle game that you need to implement in your code project:

// You must use either the do-while statement or the while statement as an outer game loop.
// The hero and the monster start with 10 health points.
// All attacks are a value between 1 and 10.
// The hero attacks first.
// Print the amount of health the monster lost and their remaining health.
// If the monster's health is greater than 0, it can attack the hero.
// Print the amount of health the hero lost and their remaining health.
// Continue this sequence of attacking until either the monster's health or hero's health is zero or less.
// Print the winner.

int monster = 10;
